## ⚙️ Key Operations (Explained in Theory)

1. **Data Preview:**

   * View and validate the first few records of each table to understand the structure and data types.

2. **Row Count Summary:**

   * Determine the total number of records available in each table.

3. **Data Quality Checks:**

   * Identify and count missing (NULL) values column-wise for all tables.
   * Calculate the percentage of NULL values to assess data completeness.

4. **Descriptive Statistics:**
